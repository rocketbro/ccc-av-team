## Worship Planning Software

- - -
<br>

#### Early Ideas
1. Items in the service need to have a comment thread feature
2. Auto suggestions or notes (?)
3. Need templates: AM Default, PM Default, Lord's supper, etc 
4. Dropdown on plan view to see the next plans
5. List of song options as soon as you click on a song item
6. Element of Worship database - not just songs. See when call to worships have been paired with which songs, etc
7. Need to track CCLI numbers for reporting at the end. 
8. Importing is important from CCLI and Song Select.

#### Main Analytics & Filtering
1. History for all service types for any song, or any individual service type
2. Topic
3. Lyrics
4. Arrangement or Tune Name 
5. Song type: contemporary, hymn, psalm
